# Inconsistent Tailwind CSS Class Application

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are inconsistently applied in certain components.  The core problem appears to be related to class ordering or potential conflicts, leading to the styling not being rendered correctly.

## Bug Description

In the provided example, the `bg-red-500` and `p-4` classes are expected to apply a red background and padding to the div element. However, only in some components, the classes are not applied correctly.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run the application: `npm start` or `yarn start`
4. Observe the inconsistent styling in different components, with some showing correct styling and others not.

## Solution
